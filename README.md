## Features

### Recording
- **Automatic Tab Audio Capture**: Records audio from the current Chrome tab automatically without requiring user selection.
- **Non-Muting Recording**: Audio continues to play through your speakers/headphones while recording.
- **Background Recording**: Recording continues even when the extension popup is closed.
- **Real-time Waveform Visualization**: See live, high-performance waveform visualization while recording.
- **Optimized Internal Storage**: Recordings are stored internally as WAV to ensure zero-loss quality and eliminate the need for re-conversion when changing export preferences.
- **Tab Title Naming**: Optional automatic naming using the current tab title (available in Preferences).

### Playback & Controls
- **Play/Pause Controls**: Standard audio playback controls.
- **Waveform Scrubbing**: Click anywhere on the waveform to seek to that position.
- **Non-Destructive Trimming**: Use handles on the waveform to select a specific region. Trim values are automatically persisted and restored for each recording.
- **Smooth Playhead**: Interpolated playhead movement for smooth visual updates.
- **Vertical Zoom**: Zoom in/out to increase the waveform's vertical height for detailed manual alignment and viewing.
- **Persistence & Restore**: Each recording restores its last used trim values and play position when reloaded.
- **Return to Start**: Reset playback position to the beginning (or start of trim).
- **Loop Playback**: Toggle loop mode for continuous playback of the selected region.

### Format & Preferences
- **Full Format Support**: Record and export in **WAV**, **WEBM**, **MP3**, or **OGG** formats.
- **MP3 Encoding**: High-quality MP3 encoding using `lamejs`.
- **Sample Rate Selection**: Choose from 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz, or 192kHz.
- **Channel Mode**: Select mono or stereo.
- **Bit Depth (WAV)**: Choose 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit for exports.
- **Volume Normalization**: Optional automatic peak normalization to maximize loudness without clipping.
- **Instant Configuration**: Preferences change export behavior on-the-fly without requiring re-processing of the original recording.
- **Persistent Preferences**: All settings are saved and persist across sessions.

### Recent Recordings
- **IndexedDB Storage**: Uses IndexedDB for high-capacity, virtually unlimited storage of recordings.
- **Metadata View**: See file sizes, duration, timestamps, and channel modes (mono/stereo) at a glance.
- **Auto-Update**: Recordings list updates automatically when preferences (like format) change.
- **Quick Access**: Play, download, or delete any recording from your history.

### UI/UX
- **Modern Design**: Sleek, clean interface using the Inter font.
- **Multiple Themes**: Choose between **Dark**, **Light**, **Midnight**, and **Forest** themes, each with unique icons and color palettes.
- **Minimalist Iconography**: Custom-designed theme icons (Sun, Moon, Wave, Tree) and a unified multi-color extension icon representing all themes.
- **Dynamic Visuals**: Processing state indicators, pulsing recording button, and live waveform processing.
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized to fit perfectly within the extension popup without unnecessary scrolling.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd AudioSplitterChromeExtension
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:

## Usage

### Recording Audio

1. **Start Recording**:
   - Click the extension icon in Chrome's toolbar.
   - Click the red circular record button.
   - The button transforms into a square stop button while recording and pulses.

2. **During Recording**:
   - Audio continues playing normally.
   - Real-time waveform visualization appears.
   - Recording continues even if you close the popup.

3. **Stop Recording**:
   - Click the square stop button.
   - The full waveform appears with trim handles.
   - Recording is automatically saved to Recent Recordings.

### Playing & Editing

- **Play/Pause**: Use the play button in the center.
- **Trim**: Drag the colored handles at the start and end of the waveform to select a region.
- **Seek**: Click anywhere on the waveform to jump to that position.
- **Zoom**: Use the `+` and `-` buttons to adjust the vertical scale of the waveform.
- **Loop**: Toggle loop mode to repeat the trimmed area.

### Managing Recordings

- **Recent Recordings**: Click the center tab to view history.
- **Play/Load**: Click a recording's name or the play icon to load it into the main view.
- **Download**: Click the download icon. It will use your current format/sample rate preferences.
- **Delete**: Click the trash icon to permanently remove a recording.


### Preferences

- **file type**: Choose your export format (WAV, WEBM, MP3, OGG).
- **sample rate**: Up to 192kHz for high-fidelity capture.
- **bit depth**: Configurable for WAV files (16/24/32-bit).
- **normalize**: Peak normalization for consistent volume.
- **use tab title**: Automatically use the current tab's name for new recordings.

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Webpack
- **Audio Engine**: 
  - Web Audio API for playback and analysis.
  - `lamejs` for MP3 encoding.
  - Custom PCM encoders for WAV (16/24/32-bit).
- **Chrome APIs**: 
  - `chrome.tabCapture` - For capturing tab audio.
  - `chrome.offscreen` - For reliable background audio processing and recording.
  - `chrome.storage.local` - For preferences, settings, and trim metadata.
  - `chrome.storage.session` - For temporary UI state.
- **Storage Strategy**: 
  - **IndexedDB**: High-capacity storage for multi-track audio data.
  - **Internal WAV**: All recordings are stored as raw WAV data to ensure consistency and eliminate re-conversion cpu overhead.

### Storage Capacity

- **Managed Storage**: While IndexedDB allows for large amounts of data, the extension manages storage to ensure browser performance.
- **Persistence**: Data survives browser restarts and extension updates.

### Permissions

- `tabCapture` - To capture audio from browser tabs.
- `tabs` - To access current tab information for naming.
- `storage` - To save recordings and preferences.
- `activeTab` - To interact with the current active tab.

## Experimental & Future Features

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The features listed below are experimental and may not be fully implemented or available on the current branch.

### AI Stem Splitting & Sound Isolation
We are exploring the integration of high-performance AI models and APIs (such as **Suno** or other stem-splitting engines) to enable advanced audio manipulation. Potential experimental features include:
- **Lead Vocal & Instrumental Separation**: Isolate vocals or backing tracks from any recording.
- **Sound Isolation**: Use AI to extract or remove specific sound events (e.g., background noise, specific instruments) from captured audio.
- **Advanced Stem Export**: Download recordings separated into multiple high-fidelity tracks.
